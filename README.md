# Experimental Project (Oct. 2019 - Feb. 2020)
This is a collection of images documenting exploratory research of abstract 2D fluid simulations and Mandelbrot/Julia Set variations.
The purpose of this project was to visually understand and explore complex numbers and their relationship to turbulence at an intuitive level. 

## Notes:
* Screenshots were captured and named spontaneously over many iterations of experimental code.
* File names may or may not hint at image significance.
